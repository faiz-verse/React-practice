Necessary packages:

npm install express mongoose cors multer dotenv

express → Web framework for handling routes.
mongoose → MongoDB ODM for managing database operations.
cors → Allows cross-origin requests from your frontend.
multer → Handles file uploads.
dotenv → Stores environment variables securely.

Connecting to MongoDB – React cannot directly interact with MongoDB. The backend (Express + Mongoose) will handle all database operations.

Processing file uploads – We'll use multer (a middleware for handling file uploads) with Express to receive and store uploaded files.

Security & CORS – Express will allow our frontend (file-bucket) to talk to the backend (file-bucket-backend) by enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
